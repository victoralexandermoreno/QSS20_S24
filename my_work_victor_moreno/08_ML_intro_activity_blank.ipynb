Once you're on the lengthy waitlist along with a small crowd of others, they want you to think.... wow, this is a happening place!\\n\\nBut the pain doesn't stop here.  The hostess has strict but unreasonable seating rules.  Example: she wouldn't seat my party of 4 at a 4 top table because 2 people were parking the car.  Not even 30 seconds later, she seats a party of 2 at that last remaining 4 top table.  Then, of course, my 2 missing people walk right up and we have to wait 25 minutes for the next available 4 top table.  Great policy, Oreganos!\\n\\nThis self-styled Chicago theme restaurant offers deep dish pizza, but they're quick to point out how long the wait is for the pizza (likely after you've waited a long time just to get a seat) and so the vast majority of their pizza sales are thin crust.  Not bad, but the reputation for great Chicago pizza isn't exactly \\\"Chicago thin crust\\\".\\n\\nWall murals are entertaining, as are the self-deprecating T-shirts worn by the staff.

       "      <td>If you've been to any Oregano's anywhere, you know what the food here is like. If you like the food, you like it. I find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait.\\n\\nThis particular joint is always busy to the point of overcrowding for lunch and dinner. Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Despite decent servers you will have a wait, either to sit down at all, or quite a wait for your pizza. Takeout is a good option. \\n\\nParking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough, so there is spillover into the local neighborhood. BE CAREFUL: People who have been drinking tend to drive out of there without even looking. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, not even a CD. The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.\\n\\nThe negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain. And because I live in this neighborhood, and we have found Oregano's most unreceptive to working with the neighborhood residents to overcome parking and litter problems, and an increase in crime associated with these problems.</td>\n",

It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.   \n",

I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.   \n",

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.   \n",

The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \\n\\nSecond, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation!   \n",

       "14995  Fabricated hype is the theme for this restaurant chain in Arizona - they intentionally select (nearly) all locations with insufficient parking and insufficient building size to accommodate their customers.  Once you're on the lengthy waitlist along with a small crowd of others, they want you to think.... wow, this is a happening place!\\n\\nBut the pain doesn't stop here.  The hostess has strict but unreasonable seating rules.  Example: she wouldn't seat my party of 4 at a 4 top table because 2 people were parking the car.  Not even 30 seconds later, she seats a party of 2 at that last remaining 4 top table.  Then, of course, my 2 missing people walk right up and we have to wait 25 minutes for the next available 4 top table.  Great policy, Oreganos!\\n\\nThis self-styled Chicago theme restaurant offers deep dish pizza, but they're quick to point out how long the wait is for the pizza (likely after you've waited a long time just to get a seat) and so the vast majority of their pizza sales are thin crust.  Not bad, but the reputation for great Chicago pizza isn't exactly \\\"Chicago thin crust\\\".\\n\\nWall murals are entertaining, as are the self-deprecating T-shirts worn by the staff.  Food is very average, and the menu is quite decorative.\\n\\nOn the whole though, it's all hype and little in way of substance.   \n",

The first time I ate here I was so overwhelmed by the menu there are so many options and all of them sound great. This isn't an authentic Italian restaurant but I like how they make all the classic dishes with a twist . The portions are huge and the prices are reasonable. The food here is pretty good try the Boom Dip as an appetizer and don't forget to leave room for the Pizookie its heavenly.   \n",

I try to frequent mostly local owned restaurants, but Oregano's just calls to me sometimes.  I love the unique salad selection and the fact that I get to choose small or large.  The pizza crust is the perfect thin-ness, the spices just right, I don't have to spend a fortune AND I get leftovers!  \\nNow the service...again, I have never had to wait for drink refills, hunt down my server for extra napkins, or send back a cold pizza.  I always get upbeat and personable service and as a server mysef, this really makes me happy.  \\nI don't remember every server's name I have had there, but definitely ask for Trish for great experience!   \n",

Everything tastes as if someone had an accident with the salt shaker in the kitchen. Bland, boring, and dehydrating. No thanks.   \n",
       "14999                                                     If you've been to any Oregano's anywhere, you know what the food here is like. If you like the food, you like it. I find it much too salty and not really worth the long wait.\\n\\nThis particular joint is always busy to the point of overcrowding for lunch and dinner. Service is good and they have outdoor seating. Despite decent servers you will have a wait, either to sit down at all, or quite a wait for your pizza. Takeout is a good option. \\n\\nParking is a problem because the restaurant doesn't have enough, so there is spillover into the local neighborhood. BE CAREFUL: People who have been drinking tend to drive out of there without even looking. Do not leave any valuables visible in your car, not even a CD. The area around 10th St and Camelback experiences a lot of smash and grab theft and even assault, so be aware of your surroundings. It's a good neighborhood, but buzzed, well-fed people are easy marks.\\n\\nThe negative review is because I think you can do a LOT better while supporting a locally owned place instead of a chain. And because I live in this neighborhood, and we have found Oregano's most unreceptive to working with the neighborhood residents to overcome parking and litter problems, and an increase in crime associated with these problems.   \n",
